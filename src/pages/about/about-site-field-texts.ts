  brief:
    "This website is intended to be an ever-improving display of my capabilities, especially as they relate to web application development.  It's my learning ground (especially for frontend development as well as Go development), a place for experimentation, and a place to showcase my current capabilities.",
  p2: "Everything here - for better or for worse - has been created by me with the help of React & Ant Design. Also, I've leveraged ChatGPT significantly to help me build this.",
  p3: `I'm pretty happy with how it's coming along, and I've learned a lot as I've built this site. I'm constantly striving for a better look, feel, and interaction, as well as dreaming up things to add - often simply for the sake of learning. Check the "Things I Like" section below for ... ADD STUFF HERE MICHAEL`,
  p4: `I really like how I've split component semantics from their content.  As an example, this text (yes, THIS text!) is in a .ts file and is imported into the component, thus not distracting someone reading the code from the component itself.`,
